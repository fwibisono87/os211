# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [The Malware Museum](http://archive.org/details/malwaremuseum)<br>
The Malware Museum is a collection of viruses that used to be the scourge of personal computers in the 90s. As i used to operate on an antiquated version of Windows (Windows 95), I find it fascinating. Moreover, it's somewhat related to our current material, security!
2. [A Christmas Computer Bug, and the Future of Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNm-b1UXGTYA)<br>
A video by Tom Scott, about one of the first computer worms, and about computer protection. It is interesting to me as it also describes about secure storage and how storage might evolve in the future. 
3. [Hashing Algorithms and Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg))<br>
Yet another video from Tom Scott over at the Computerphile Youtube Channel, describing how do Hashing Algorithms work, and why we might need to use them. It is interesting to me as Tom has a way of describing things that keep me interested and help me learn.
ay to access the console from within a GUI. It is usable almost universally across all operating systems (well, except most consumer Android ROMs).
4. [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY)
A video by Dr. Mike Pound, describing the first Secure Hashing Algorithm. Here he explains how to generate random hash strings from files. It's interesting to me as it describes a seemingly complex concept simply.
5. [Public Key Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4)
A video detailing how Public Key Cryptography works, by Robert Miles. It helped me understand how Public Key Cryptography works, and why we had to sign our assignments with pgp!
6. [How Secure Shell Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORcvSkgdA58)
Dr. Steve Bagley describes how SSH works on this video. SSH is a way to connect machines over the network. I find it interesting because it, again, explains a complex concept relatively simply
7. [Secure Copy Vulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcesKgfSPq4)
Yet another Computerphile video, this time describing a vulnerability in the Secure Copy Program (A program to send files between computers). I stumbled upon it as i frantically try to save my private key.
8. [Why You Should Turn On Two Factor Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGRii5f_uSc)
In this video, Tom Scott explains Multi Factor Authentication, and why we need it. It interests me because it reminds me that you can never be too safe.
9. [Access-control List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list)
Access Control List is basically a "bouncer's list", which determines which user can do what with a speciific object.
10. [SUDO vulnerability](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit)
An old vulnerability was found in UNIX-based systems, allowing users to gain superuser status without authenticationn
