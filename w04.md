#Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Hardware Protection Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udM5Fs2keWo)<br>
As usual, kicking off the list with yet another video from Udacity, describing diffrent schemas where hardware protection might be run. For exampl, x86 has 4 protection modes (kernel -> device driver -> more non-core drivers -> apps), and also 2 modes, root and non-root.
2. [Memory allocation Algorithm :First Fit , Next Fit , Best Fit , Worst Fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Mjt7rIr3Q)<br>
Aah, Indian youtubers, saviours of CS students everywhere. This video explains the algorithm used to allocate memory. Basically, there are 4 ways we can put stuff into our memory. First fit finds the next slot big enough to store our data in the memory map. Next fit finds the slot that fits after the previous slot we use. Best fit finds the slot with the minimum size nessescary to store our data, and worst fit throws effficiency out of the window and puts the data in the largest slot available.
3. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)
If we *really* wanted to go step by step, this should've been in spot 2, but I like videos better so, yeah. This page by describes memory management pretty well, from how the OS addresses memory, Static&Dynamic Loading&Linking, Swapping and Paging, Allocation, Fragmentation, and Segmentation.
4. [What is swap, really?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgefj9ibRE)<br>
A video detailing Linux Swap, and it's uses. It basically is the linux equivalent of the Windows pagefile, acting as secondary memory that the OS can dump info to when it's full/needs to power down and resume again with the exact same system state(hibernation).
5. [Page File - LTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br>
Won't be a fwibisono87 top 10 list without a video from 'mas linus' :D. A tell all video about what and why Windows needs a pagefile.
6. [Endianness Explained With an Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>
Obligatory Computerphile video (lol, i'm making this list anyways, might as well have fun :p). Big vs Little endian is basically how a computer writes(stores) values larger than 1 byte. The analogy is, big endian reads left-to-right, and little endian reads right-to-left. Another way of putting it is where we keep the MSB and LSB in a system.
7. [Pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc)<br>
Professor Brailsford explains pointers with linked lists and legos. seriously, worth a watch!
8. [How Dynamic RAM workds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A1e8eceIsY)<br>
This video brings a lot of realizations to me, like the fact that SIMM (single inline memory modules) exists, SRAM (static RAM) exists, and the fact that modern DRAM as both system memory and video memory are designed to "forget"
9. [Dynamic memory allocation in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDVC3wKjS64)<br>
Memory allocation implementation in C, and how we can use them
10. [Static and Dynamic Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re5Z607jA0A)<br>
This is the least obnoxious video i could find in the adpocolypseland we call youtube, describing the types of linux libraries, and why shared libraries are quack.
