#Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Basically Everything we discuss this week](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENFeb-J75k)<br>
This Computerphile video apparently discusses everything since last week, whoops
2. [Critical Section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSX1YEoCVgA)<br>
A video explaining briefly about critical sections and it's problems. The guy reminds me of Pavel for some reason.
3. [Dekker's and Peterson's Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMBwwzc5I68)<br>
_literally_ the only good explaination video I can find about Dekker's and Peterson's Algorithm.
4. [Semaphores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukM_zzrIeXs&t)<br>
A pretty graphic way of what a semaphore is, how to use it, why we use it, and why it's diffrent from regular mutexes
5. [Bounded Buffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRiN3DJdskA)<br>
A video explaining the Bounded Buffer problem, and some of it's solutions.
6. [Dining Philosophers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbwbQQB7xNQ)<br>
A short and fast explanation on the Dining Philosophers' Problem, and it's solution. The guy looks like OzzyManReviews
7. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
I give up searching for a video for this one. GFG does it pretty well anyways. Kind of a long read, tho
8. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
All the 5W+H on deadlock and it's avoidance strategies.
9. [Race Conditions and How To Prevent Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)<br>
A much simpler explaination of Race Conditions and Dekker's Algo.
10. [Semaphore vs Mutex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF3AsTglUU)<br>
A graphical comparison of Semaphores and Mutexes
