# Top 10 List of Week 01
1. [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)<br>
Virtualisation is a way to run other 'computers' within the same system. It's interesting to me as I can use it to perform Linux distro-hopping conviniently and relatively risk-free.
2. [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)<br>
Linux is a Unix-based operating system, which is open source, and has a lot of "flavors"(distros - distributions) that we can pick, based on both taste and need. Moreover, it is known to be able to run in a multitude of platforms, from ARM, AMD64, x86, and even RISC-V. Because of it's open-source status, we can adapt and use it freely.
3. [The Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))<br>
The kernel is the "heart" of the OS, which allows other programs in the userspace to be able to communicate with the hardware in a system. It fascinates me that a 112 Megabyte code package (Linux Kernel 5.11.3) can manage system resources so well!
4. [The Linux Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console)<br>
The Linux Console is a way for the Kernel and other applications to interact with a user. It only requires the keyboard as an input device, so it is ideal as a fallback method for safe modes.
5. [Terminal Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)<br>
The terminal emulator is a way that most of us use the terminal daily, as it is the only way to access the console from within a GUI. It is usable almost universally across all operating systems (well, except most consumer Android ROMs).
6. [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim)<br>
Vim is a text editor contained entirely from the Terminal. It is one of the most popular ways to code for "power-users", as it is entirely CLI-based, you rarely need to take your hands off your keyboard, therefore *supposedly* you are able to code with utmost efficiency
7. [Vim in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txKSRn0qeA&t=148s)<br>
A video I found by Fireship, explaining the basics of Vim, and why we should use Vim.
8. [Advanced Package Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software))<br>
Users of Debian-based Linux distributions should be familiar with APT, as one of the easiest ways to get new software for our system. It allows us to retrieve, configure, and install software packages automatically from defined sources. An interesting side note, UI has it's own Ubuntu mirror, along with other software, at http://kambing.ui.ac.id
9. [Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano)<br>
Nano is yet another text editor, reffered to my by one of my friends as "the friendlier cousin of Vim". Indeed, even though it is also CLI-based, it feels somewhat more welcoming (probably because the shortcut keys are literally written on the bottom of the terminal).
10. [Installing multiple APT packages](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/MoreDebianPackages.html)<br>
Honestly I am a bit surprised that you can just make a list of packages and execute a single command to install them all... I used to just chain commands with '&&'... oh, think of the time i could've saved!
