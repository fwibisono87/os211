#Finale!

Hello, whoever is crazy enough to read this!
I assume you are reading this for OS212, and I congratulate you!
Here are the points you need to know!

1. Come to class!<br>
Yes, it helps, even just to go get the weekly codes.
2. Get friends!<br>
The more the merrier, eh? At least you can remind each other that you *actually* have deadlines, lmao
3. GOOGLE!<br>
or, GSGS! it helps with troubleshooting and understanding a lot!

Well, OS211, you've been great, but I hope we  will never have to meet again :D

And for the last time,
Jolan Tru!
