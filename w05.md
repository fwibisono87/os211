#Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [What is Virtual Memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
Gary from Android Authority explains the basics and implementation of Virutal Memory. Apparently it is a way to optimize memory routing, and to make the most of our physical memory!
2. [Process Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEh6ZVP_U1w)<br>
A video from the Univerity of Washington's Dr. Robert Dimpsey, demonstrating how virtual memory performs, from the prespective of a program.
3. [Memory Hierarchy Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3omVLzI0WE)<br>
A lecture from the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT) OpenCourseWare(OCW), detailing what is a memory hierarchy, the various ways it can be implemented, and it's tradeoffs.
4. [Even more Memory Hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oOdsbRPb2Y)<br>
Yet another MIT OCW material, this time slightly more modern (2017), and describes the memory hierarchy in more detail, focusing more on the hardware side.
5. [Demand Paging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOVrEbZVeoU)<br>
One of the few videos I can find that explains demand paging pretty well.
6. [Page Faults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bShqyf-hDfg)<br>
A lecture that explains a page fault pretty well, and how do we handle it. Basically the OS performs a CRUD operation on the page table, lol.
7. [But then how do you make virtual memory, you know, fast?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyrSn3qbZ8U)<br>
*vsauce theme plays* A lecture from the same guy as #6 (David Black-Schaffer), telling us how the quack we can make virtual memory fast, as otherwise, we have to go and read the page table. _sda go brrr_ (spoiler: go get a cache, lol)
8. [Memory Allocation - slab and buddy system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRAHRJEAEso)<br>
A video by corpse husband (jkjk, but Gabriel does sound like corpse tho). It is kind of longform, but it explains memory allocation by the os very, _very_ exhaustively.
9. [What is NUMA?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmb8xGD-LV8)<br>
A video explaining Non Uniform Memory access, basically how a single computer can operate with multiple CPU's.
10. [Should you put 2 CPUs in your PC?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n-0TByKOPc)<br>
Obligatory LTT video, telling how and why multi-CPUs in consumer-grade PCs are quack. (also, of course AMD did it first)
